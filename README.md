# Multi-Word-Int v4.93
Version 4 is deprecated and no longer being updated. Please use version 5 instead.

Library to provide multi-word (large) integers for the Free Pascal compiler.
Designed to be reasonably fast, and requiring minimal changes to existing code.
Provides basic arithmetic operations add, subtract, multiply, divide, exclusive-or, power, odd, even, bit shift.
Provides implicit/automatic conversions to other types wherever possible.
Will compile and run on 32bit and 64bit environments.
Written purely in Pascal to be portable and reliable (no assembly or C language code).

Changes in this version:
-	slightly faster decimal ansistring conversion for Multi_Int_X2/3/4 types
- some code tidy-up
