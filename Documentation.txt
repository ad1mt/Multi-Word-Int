Multi-Word-Int

Multi-Word-Int is a large integer library for the Free Pascal compiler.
It is written entirely in Pascal, works in both 32bit and 64bit environments, so should be portable to any platform that is targeted by the compiler. It has been tested on Windows 10 with Intel CPU (32bit & 64bit), and Linux on Raspberry Pi ARM CPU (32bit & 64bit).
The library is designed to be as easy to use as possible. In most cases, the large integer types are used in exactly the same way as the standard built-in integers. Automatic/implicit type conversion is provided for most other numerical types, and also for conversion from strings to large integer. Where automatic/implicit type conversion is not available, explicit type conversion functions/procedures/methods are provided.
One the main design aims is to allow existing code to be changed to use the library with minimal changes.

Large Integer Types

The large integer types provided are:
Multi_Int_X2 :	fixed 2 word integer
In a 64bit environment this equals 128 bits, in a 32bit environment this equals 64 bits.

Multi_Int_X3 :	fixed 3 word integer
In a 64bit environment this equals 192 bits, in a 32bit environment this equals 96 bits.

Multi_Int_X4 :	fixed 4 word integer
In a 64bit environment this equals 256 bits, in a 32bit environment this equals 128 bits.

Multi_Int_XV :	variable size multiple word integer

The default size of the Multi_Int_XV type is defined by the calling code in a parameter to the initialisation procedure; this is in half-words. So, if you specify 128, this equals 64 whole words, which equals 4096 bits in a 64bit environment. For example:   Multi_Int_Initialisation(64); 

The Multi_Int_XV type has a maximum size which is set at 2x the default in the initialisation function. The limit can be changed by calling Multi_Int_Set_XV_Limit, where you can specify an alternate maximum size, like this:   Multi_Int_Set_XV_Limit(75);   

As the number contained in a Multi_Int_XV variable gets larger, the size of the variable expands to a size that can contain the number. If the maximum size limit is reached, an overflow exception/error is generated.

Individual variables of type Multi_Int_XV can no longer be resized explicitly; the Multi_Int_Reset_XV_Size function is no longer available, due to problems with implementation.

The larger the size of Multi_Int_XV variables, the slower the calculations become.
The fixed-size types Multi_Int_X2, Multi_Int_X3 and Multi_Int_X4 are provided for maximum speed, the Multi_Int_XV type is provided for maximum flexibility. 

Operators

The following operators are provided:
+ :	add
- :	subtract (also unary minus)
* :	multiply
div :	divide
mod :	modulo
** : 	power
abs :	absolute value
xor :	bitwise exclusive-or
and :	bitwise And function
not :	bitwise Not function
or :	bitwise Or function
shr :	bit shift right
shl :	bit shift left

The standard comparison/logical operators are provided:
  = 	equals
 <> 	not-equals
 >	greater-than
 >=	greater-than-or-equal-to
 <	less-than 
<=	less-than-or-equal-to
These can be used in expressions in the same was as standard built-in integers.

The bitwise operations are performed on the absolute values. The sign of the result is then calculated according to the following rules:
xor - if the signs are different, the result is negative, otherwise the result is positive
or - if the both signs are negative, the result is negative, otherwise the result is positive
and - if the both signs are negative, the result is negative, otherwise the result is positive
not - if the sign is positive, the result is negative, otherwise the result is positive

Type Conversion

Conversion to/from other types is automatic/implicit, for the following types:
to/from integers
to/from real  (with significant loss of precision)
from string (decimal notation is assumed)
from smaller Multi_Int_X types to larger ones (from larger to smaller requires explicit conversion via methods)

Explicit conversion to/from other types is provided for the following types:
to string in decimal notation with the ToStr method;
to/from string in hex notation with ToHex and FromHex methods/functions;
to any large integer type from any other with typecast functions:
 To_Multi_Int_XV,
 To_Multi_Int_X4,
 To_Multi_Int_X3
 To_Multi_Int_X2.

One has to be careful when using implicit type/value conversions. When using a numeric type or literal that is greater than a standard integer maximum value, the compiler will assume (or implicitly cast to) a float type, then assign that float value to the Multi_Int, and lose a significant amount of precision. An example is the following assignment:

var V:Multi_Int;
V:=18446744073709551616;  // this value is 1 greater than the maximum amount that a uint64 type can contain.

In this case, the compiler casts the value  18446744073709551616 to a float type, then assigns the float value to the Multi_Int V.  The value that gets assigned is 18446744073709600000, not  18446744073709551616 as one might expect. The following code shows how to avoid the problem, by using a string literal:

var V:Multi_Int;
V:=’18446744073709551616’;  // this value is correctly assigned, with no loss of precision.

Explicit casting like this  V:=Multi_Int(18446744073709551616); does not help, because the literal 18446744073709551616 is interpreted as a floating point value before it reaches the cast function.

Other operations/functions

The following operations/functions are provided:
Odd(v)
Even(v)
Negative(v)			this returns a boolean
SqRoot(v,result,remainder)
SqRoot(v,result,)
Abs(v)
ShiftUp(v, Nbits)		this function has been replaced by the shl operator
ShiftDown(v, Nbits)		this function has been replaced by the shr operator
RotateUp(v, Nbits)		this function has been withdrawn
RotateDown(v, Nbits)		this function has been withdrawn

If the SqRoot (square root) function cannot give an exact result, it rounds down, and gives a remainder. Note that the SHL and SHR operators do not generate overflow exceptions, which is different to the behaviour of the equivalent native code operations.
The RotateUp and RotateDown procedures have been withdrawn, because of problems with the internal logic. 

The following methods are also provided to calling code:
v.Defined	this indicates if the variable is defined/undefined
v.Overflow	this indicates if the variable has overflowed
v.Negative	this indicates if the variable is negative

Constants

The following constants are provided (technically, these are variables calculated during initialisation):
Multi_Int_X2_MAXINT
Multi_Int_X3_MAXINT
Multi_Int_X4_MAXINT
Multi_Int_XV_MAXINT	this is recalculated whenever the size of the type is set

Exceptions

The unit exports a variable Multi_Int_RAISE_EXCEPTIONS_ENABLED, which can be set by the calling code, at any point. If set to TRUE, this enables run-time exceptions to be generated in the event of overflow and other errors. Multi_Int types have attributes named Defined and Overload which can be checked explicitly in the calling code. The unit also exports a boolean variable named Multi_Int_ERROR, which is also set after any operation that generates an error.  The Defined and Overload attributes and the Multi_Int_ERROR variable are always set, even if Multi_Int_RAISE_EXCEPTIONS_ENABLED variable is set to FALSE. If Multi_Int_RAISE_EXCEPTIONS_ENABLED is FALSE, the Defined and Overload attributes and the Multi_Int_ERROR variable can be checked from the calling code.
Note that if Multi_Int_RAISE_EXCEPTIONS_ENABLED is FALSE, when converting Multi_Int variables to other types, the only way to detect overflow errors, is via the Multi_Int_ERROR variable.

Technical Notes

The unit code will now compile & work correctly in Delphi mode or ObjFPC mode with "advancedrecords".

The code will compile in both 32bit and 64bit environments. In the unit source there is a define "{$define 64bit}" or "{$define 32bit}" which is set depending on the environment, i.e. whether standard integers are 32bit or 64bit. This is set automatically to match the version of the compiler you are using, but can be overidden.

Multi_Int_Initialisation can only be called once (previously it could be called many times, but this has been withdrawn due to problems with implementation).

The standard integer types have been aliased as follows, to make the internal unit coding easier in both 32bit and 64bit environments, and are not intended for use by calling code; the unit code depends on these, so do not change them:
	Multi_int8u = byte;
	Multi_int8 = shortint;
	Multi_int16 = smallint;
	Multi_int16u = word;
	Multi_int32 = longint;
	Multi_int32u = longword;
	Multi_int64u = QWord;
	Multi_int64 = int64;

The following integer type aliases have also  been set, to make the internal unit coding easier in both 32bit and 64bit environments, and are not intended for use by calling code; the unit code depends on these, so do not change them:
	INT_1W_S
	INT_1W_U
	INT_2W_S
and	INT_2W_U

These are aliased to the above types depending on whether "{$define 64bit}" or "{$define 32bit}" are defined. For example the following are defined for a 64bit environment. Do not change these:
	MULTI_INT_1W_S = Multi_int32;
	MULTI_INT_1W_U = Multi_int32u;
	MULTI_INT_2W_S = Multi_int64;
	MULTI_INT_2W_U = Multi_int64u;

There are is a define in the source code {$define Overflow_Checks}, which is intended for use when compiler overflow checks are enabled. The {$define Overflow_Checks} does not switch on overflow checking for you; if you wish to use overflow checking, you still need to enable this in the usual way. In short, the rule is: if you want overflow checking, turn it on in the usual way and set {$define Overflow_Checks}. If you turn on overflow checking, but do not set {$define Overflow_Checks}, then the code will turn off overflow checking at bit shift operations and will not re-enable them. On Intel CPUs, some bit shift operations trigger an undesired overflow exception, and the code disables overflow checking around these operations. The {$define Overflow_Checks} tells the code that overflow checking needs to be re-enabled after bit shift operations.

The code to overload the two-parameter Inc operator/procedure, has been withdrawn, because of problems with implementation.

The library code defines a big integer type for internal use only:
Multi_Int_X5 :	fixed 5 word integer
This type is required by the division routine.

The library code defines a unit named UBool to provide an exotic boolean type:
UBool = (UBool_UNDEF,UBool_FALSE,UBool_TRUE)
and T_Ubool. The main feature of the T_UBool and UBool types are to provide boolean variables that can have an additional value of "undefined". The Ubool unit implements implicit conversion  to/from standard boolean values, where possible. It is intended for internal library use only.

The internal structure of a large integer is an array of unsigned integers. The array elements are stored little-endian form, therefore the least significant integer array element is at index zero.
There is a boolean to represent the sign. There is no unsigned large integer type.
There is a boolean to represent whether an overflow has occurred. There is a boolean to represent whether a variable has been assigned a value, or is undefined.

// literal numbers > 64bit MAXINT should be specified as strings

P:= ((Big_Int(2) ** Big_Int(128)) – 1); // sometimes explicit type casting is necessary
if ((P - N) <> 0) then writeln('Fail!');
P:= (N ** 2);
R:= (P div N);
if (R <> N) then writeln('Fail!')
else writeln('R = N = ',R.ToStr);
sqroot(P,R,Q);
if (R <> N) or (Q <> 0)
then writeln('Fail!')
else writeln('Hex R = N = ',R.ToHex);
end.
